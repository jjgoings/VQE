    "The [variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm#Variational_quantum_eigensolver) is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm that variationally determines the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's quantum in the sense that the expectation value of the energy is computed via a quantum algorithm, but it is classical in the sense that the energy is minimized with a classical optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a molecular electronic structure perspective, it is equivalent to computing the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) for a given basis."

    "Quantum computing can be a little unintuitive, so it helps to see a working example. Although we won't actually do any \"real\" quantum computing, the methods can be understood from a linear algebra perspective. So that's what we are going to try and do for the VQE.\n",

Since we can now compute the expectation value of our Hamiltonian using quantum gates, we can pass the computed energy to a classical optimizer, which gives new parameters for the quantum gates.

We need to reduce the Hamiltonian's expected value into these types of \"easy\" projective measurements that can be done in the computational basis. These are sums of Pauli measurements.\n",

    "Thankfully, there is a way to do this. The trick is to apply an additional unitary transformation at the end of the circuit so that, by measuring the spin of the top qubit, we can obtain any Pauli measurement. In our case, that means relating each of the the $\\langle \\hat{O}_i\\rangle$ quantities to the expected value of $\\langle Z_1 \\otimes \\mathbf{I}\\rangle$ by some appropriate unitary operator.
